In order to create a derby/mysql database to run the project, do the following:

1. Run dbutils.CreateDatabase that uses JPA together with annotations to create
the database. If something is wrong with your annotations the creation will fail.
You need to fix the annotations and execute the class again.

Every time you run this class, the tables from the database will be removed
and the database will be created again. The removal and creation of tables 
is based on the current metadata, so, if there is a change in the metadata,
classes can be wrongly deleted (because they were created using annotations
that are no longer in place). In this cases remove (manually) the database
and run the dbutils.CreateDatabase again.

The script used to insert values are in META-INF/load-script.sql 

2. In case you need to reset the tables, run dbutils.ResetTables as in 
the other projects as you did before. The script it runs is in META-INF/resetTables.sql. 

3. The project can use MySql or Derby. 

There are two persistence files "persistence-derby.xml" and "persistence-mysql.xml"
in META-INF (src/main/resources). The former is configure to access a derby database;
the latter for accessing mysql. Just copy the contents of the file you need to  
access the database to "persistence.xml". 

For instance, copy the persistence-derby.xml to persistence.xml to access the derby database.

4. You can now run the startup.Startup

5. If you want to run using the MySql database, besides copying the
persistence-mysql.xml to persistence.xml, do not forget to connect to FCUL VPN 
before running dbutils.CreateDatabase or startup.Startup.
